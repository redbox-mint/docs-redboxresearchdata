## []()Project complete

Please note that the EIF048 project has been completed and the final report submitted to ANDS. A [public version of the final report](governance-eif048-EIF048_ReDBox%20-%20Final%20Report%20-%20Public-pdf?attredirects=0) is available for your reading pleasure.
## []()Overview

**START DATE: June 2011
END DATE: June 2012
**

The EIF040 project to develop ReDBox at USQ was funded by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). The development of Version 1.0 was completed on 13th May 2011, including deployment at University of Newcastle.

This project (EIF048) is for the development of ReDBox Version 1.1, to develop fixes for issues and defects found by the University of Newcastle and address new product functionality and completion of product artefacts to result in a more stable and complete release of the ReDBox product. This would also increase the likelihood of other universities taking up ReDBox to meet their research meta-data management requirements.
 
## []()Deliverables
EIF048 Outlines the following deliverables:

* D1: Completion of a Project Plan (using ANDS template), specifying the details of the planned activity, with risks, schedules, etc., and providing an ethics and privacy statement where needed. 
* D5: Enhancements to RedBox functionality (RedBox 1.1) which satisfy the aims and objectives given above; namely: 

 * D5.1: Usability enhancements and defect fixes identified through the University of Newcastle deployment, and any subsequent deployments at other universities which occur during the proposed project. 
 * D5.2: Functionality resulting from known requirements of other universities interested in taking up ReDBox; including standalone functionality (non-VITAL), genericising VITAL/Fedora integration outside of University of Newcastle; and deploying RedBox under HTTPS. 
 * Enhancements to RedBox and Mint, including but not restricted to: 

  * D5.3: Mint: application feeds into Mint; defining services; automated data feeds in; relations between entities; improved EAC-CPF feed to NLA. 
  * D5.4: RedBox: improved search and indexing; storage plugin. 
* D7: Deposit of the software outlined in D5 in either Google Code or SourceForge: 

 * Including a Google code comment and tag / SourceForge summary and tag containing the text “ANDS-funded”. 
 * Accompanied by developer manuals to facilitate re-use. 
 * Accompanied by deployment manuals to facilitate external deployment 
 * Accompanied by user manuals to facilitate use. 
* D9: Progress reports to ANDS using ANDS templates. 
* D10: Final report to ANDS using ANDS templates. 
* D11: A minimum of one deployment of RedBox1.1 to an institution, to the satisfaction of that institution, and satisfying a mutually agreed range of enhancements and customisations. Both the institution and ANDS will sign off on the range of enhancements and customisations for each deployment beforehand.
