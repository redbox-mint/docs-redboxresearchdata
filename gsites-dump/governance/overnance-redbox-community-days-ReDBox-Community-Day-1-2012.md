### []()Ideas Sessions
The Ideas Session is aimed at allowing the user group to nominate features that they’d like to see implemented. Prior to the Community Day, participants will be asked to nominate features they’d like to see developed. In the afternoon session, priority features will be selected for discussion in an Ideas Session.

Each session will be broken into 3 x 20minute segments, each consisting:

* Overview of the proposed feature by submitter
* Discussion within the group
* Indication of interest from user group
The goal is to provide a very high-level scope for each feature and determine those users that are interested in developing the feature.



A call will be put out prior to the community day to elicit each institution's top 2-3 features. These will be posted to the [Community Day Ideas Session](governance-redbox-community-days-ReDBox-Community-Day-1-2012-community-day-ideas) page.
