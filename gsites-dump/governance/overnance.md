The ReDBox and Mint systems are both Open Source software and we'd like to ensure that efforts to develop the system are as transparent as possible.

### []()Meeting details


Meeting arrangements are posted to the development mailing list: [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/redbox-dev/DVgNUgXOK_4/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/redbox-dev/DVgNUgXOK_4/discussion) 
All members of the ReDBox and Fascinator communities are welcome to attend these meetings. It's not a hugely formal meeting but we have limited time. This means we'll take a Pig & Chicken approach with TMC members being pigs - no insult intended :) (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig)).

Basic etiquette:

* The members of the TMC have the floor for discussion but community members are welcome to listen in. 
* Non-TMC members should have their mic and webcam muted and do not generally contribute to the meeting 
* ... unless they are directly addressed by a TMC member or listed against a discussion item. 
* If you disagree with something please use the mailing list(s) to raise your concerns
* If you would like to raise a discussion item, please email either [redbox-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:redbox-dev@googlegroups-com) or [the-fascinator-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:the-fascinator-dev@googlegroups-com) with an agenda item.
