ReDBox and Mint are open source systems, relying on a community model for development. Formal projects may provide feature development (see [Project governance](governance)) but development work may happen through a number of efforts.


The feature planning section seeks to highlight development work that is being discussed. The goal is to be open about new feature requirements/specifications and to garner support where possible. You are encouraged to nominate features of interest and work with the community to determine how development may occur.


The table below lists the current features under discussion and the nominated lead groups undertaking development.


A [template for feature development planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeQUr8GpzAMLYg_OrVx8F8OvwvV_TrcfAiZu0djbLEo/edit?usp=sharing) is available.
