Rob Cook, the QCIF CEO announced our new funding arrangements in an email to the ANDS mailing list. A copy of the email is provided below and the announcement is attached for your reading pleasure.

Hi everyone

This is to announce that the ReDBox research metadata management software is being supported and further developed by QCIF through the generosity of ANDS in funding the work and CQU by hosting the key development team.  The software was originally developed by Peter Sefton's team at the University of Southern Queensland with the University of Newcastle.   The software is in use at Newcastle and the team is developing a further release.

QCIF is keen to work through ANDS connections to promote the use of ReDBox in suitable universities throughout Australia and to provide support and installation services.

Cheers, Rob
