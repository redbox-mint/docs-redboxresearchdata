Both Mint and ReDBox historically offered a packaged server to deploy with each released version. With the release of v1.4 the package is still available, but it is a specific demonstration setup not intended for production use. Both the historic ZIPs and the new demo packages are [available from the developer site for download](http://code.google.com/p/redbox-mint/downloads/list) (older versions are hidden as deprecated, but they are there). 
This section of the documentation deals with legacy instructions for deploying the deprecated ZIPs. This documentation is no longer maintained, but feel free to ask questions on the mailing list if problems arise.
