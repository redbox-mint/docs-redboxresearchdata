A range of sample installation packages are available. Please note that these are primarily for testing/exploration. For those seeking to use ReDBox in a production system we suggest you implement an institutional build (see [Create your own Institutional Build](documentation-how-to-institutional-builds)).


The range of installation packages are located at: [http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/content/repositories/releases/com/googlecode/redbox-mint/](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/content/repositories/releases/com/googlecode/redbox-mint/)
