The [Developer Installation Guide](documentation-installguide-developer-installation-guide) is a good place to start for those wishing to customise/enhance ReDBox or Mint.

## []()Dev Mailing List

Our developer (technical) mailing list is a great first stop to see if others are sharing your issues: [http://groups.google.com/group/redbox-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/redbox-dev)
## []()Codebase
The ReDBox codebase is managed via GitHub. Two organisations are used to manage the code:

* [http://github.com/redbox-mint](http://github.com/redbox-mint)
* [http://github.com/redbox-mint-contrib](http://github.com/redbox-mint-contrib)

Additionally, The Fascinator (the underlying platform) has code available at:

* [http://github.com/the-fascinator](http://github.com/the-fascinator)
* [http://github.com/the-fascinator-contrib](http://github.com/the-fascinator-contrib)

If you haven't used Git before, check out [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) for a handy reference.
### []()Old codebase

We had previously (prior to Sept 2012) managed the code in GoogleCode:

* [http://code.google.com/p/redbox-mint](http://code.google.com/p/redbox-mint)
* [http://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator](http://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator)

The various issues and documentation are being migrated throughout Sept & Oct 2012.
## []()Maven

ReDBox and Mint utilise Apache Maven for build management. It's a very comprehensive system - if you've never been involved with Maven, it's best to check out [Maven: The Complete Reference](http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/) hosted by Sonatype.
## []()Development server

The development server ([http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/)) hosts a number of development-related systems, including a maven repository and continuous integration (CI) server. The CI jobs also generally produce JavaDoc - this can be handy.
## []()The Fascinator

As ReDBox and Mint are based on The Fascinator platform, it's worth heading over to that site for further technical documentation: [http://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/](http://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/)
