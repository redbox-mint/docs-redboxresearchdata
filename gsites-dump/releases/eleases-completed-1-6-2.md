ReDBox 1.6.2 provides a number of bug fixes that have arisen from the 1.6.1 release.

Additionally there are some minor new features for both ReDBox and Mint.
ReDBox:


* New CSV export option for admins that allow a complete export of records into CSV by package type. Access it on the url default/export/csv

Mint:

* Added configuration option so that you can use the PID rather than the NLAID for relationship mapping when NLA Integration is enabled

ReDBox/Mint:

* The JSONVelocityTransformer plugin can now utilise the Solr index to retrieve additional data for template generation

A more detailed technical description of this release (including bug fixes) is available on our GitHub site.
