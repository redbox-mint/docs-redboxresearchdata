We're starting to build up an FAQ to help ReDBox users get quick answers to their questions. If you'd like a question answered here, please let us know through the [ReDBox Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/redbox-repo).

## []()Q: What other FAQs have been requested?

We're working to get our FAQs into a comprehensive knowledge base. It takes time and here's what we've been asked for:

* What happens in ReDBox and RIF-Cs when you have a non-affiliation researcher with no local Mint record and no NLA Identifier?

## []()Q: What features are being planned?

Two resources will help you with this one:

* Check out our [Feature planning](feature-planning)

* Post an idea to the [community ](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/redbox-repo)- see if people are thinking about the same thing as you

## []()Q: What support options are available?

We're putting all of these details on our [Support](support) page
## []()Q: How do I integrate redbox into my organisation?

This is a very tricky question as you're likely to need to do things:

1. Setup policy and procedures around research data management
1. Install and configure ReDBox and Mint to meet these organisational constructs

We can't really help you here with the first one - it's an area requiring a lot of thought and discussion. A great place to start is the [Australian National Data Service](http://www.ands.org.au/) and the [ReDBox at Newcastle](http://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/content.php?pid=220059&sid=2058152) sites as well as our mailing list.


In terms of the second item, there's a lot of documentation to browse on this site and a demo server at http://demo.redboxresearchdata.com.au for you to test the system out. We've worked to provide a number of options for getting a [System Overview](documentation-system-overview), [Installing the Current Version](documentation-installguide-current), [loading data into ReDBox and Mint](documentation-system-administration-loading-data), and [Branding](documentation-system-administration-general-administration-branding) - it's all in our [Documentation](documentation)
## []()Q: What skills do I need on a redbox implementation project?

It all depends how far you want to go! 

* If you just want to give the system a whirl, take a look at [Installing a Demonstration Server](documentation-installguide-current-demo) it's not overly technical and might make for a fun afternoon! 
* A systems administrator should be install and configure ReDBox and Mint quite easily if you mainly want existing plug-ins etc
* A developer is likely to be needed if you want to create new features. The skill level needed here will depend on what needs to be done:

 * Working on the web interface: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Jython (Python)
 * Customising integration systems: Python, XML
 * Developing new plug-ins: Java, Apache Solr, Apache Maven

If you are looking to get some feature development underway, why not contact the [developer's list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/redbox-dev) with your plans and see what they suggest?
