## []()Q: I found a security problem! What should I do?

Security issues are taken seriously and we need to know about them. We have a [Responsible disclosure policy](governance-responsible-disclosure-policy) to make sure security is dealt with in an organised fashion.
## []()Q: What are institutional builds?

Institutional Builds provide a mechanism for your organisation to setup a ReDBox/Mint distribution that is tailored to your needs. Once you've downloaded and tested the "generic" ReDBox and Mint distributions you may want to add and/or develop features. Institutional Builds use the Apache Maven to add in extra features and tweak your system as needed. 


Details for creating a technical build can be found in [Create your own Institutional Build](documentation-how-to-institutional-builds). We have some [institutional build samples](https://github.com/organizations/redbox-mint) that you could use as a starting point.



## []()Q: Do I have to create an institutional build?

It's not mandatory by any means - a lot of things can be achieved through the system configuration and [branding](documentation-system-administration-general-administration-branding). We'd recommend using an institutional build though - it makes upgrading a lot easier.
