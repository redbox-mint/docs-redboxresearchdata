There have been a number of issues reported around the performance of the old built-in curation manager when the network of relationships related to a record became to complex or when there were a high volume of requests. To solve this problem, we have developed a new standalone curation manager (accessible by ReDBox & Mint via a REST API) that can operate without the restrictions that the Fascinator framework applies. Application is a [Grails application](https://github.com/redbox-mint/curation-manager) and is deployable to any of the common Java web containers (such as Tomcat).
