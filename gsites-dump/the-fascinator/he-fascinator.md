Both ReDBox and Mint utilise The Fascinator Platform. You'll notice that there's an overlap in configuration setting and a variety of ReDBox/Mint concepts and that's because they're both application running on top of The Fascinator.


The Fascinator has a [technical wiki](https://fascinator.usq.edu.au/trac) that will help those looking to develop ReDBox or the Mint further.
